### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gwen, I use [she/her pronouns](https://pronoun.is/she/her).

I'm an erstwhile senior software engineer; I've been coding since I was 12. Most of my professional experience is in java, with python taking second place. Rust is my favorite language. I also really <3 TypeScript. I begrudgingly admit golang is probably the best language for writing web services.

Most of the stuff on here is silly stuff I do for fun, though I was once an active committer for the [pants build system](https://pantsbuild.org). You can find more silly things I do on my [blog](https://gwenverbsnouns.com).

[Salad Theory](https://saladtheory.github.io/) is my fault.
