### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gwen, I use [she/her pronouns](https://pronoun.is/she/her).

I'm a professional software engineer, and have been coding for way too long. Most of my professional experience is in java. Rust is my favorite language.

Most of the stuff on here is silly stuff I do for fun, though I was once an active committer for the [pants build system](https://pantsbuild.org).

[Salad Theory](https://salad-theory.com) is my fault.
