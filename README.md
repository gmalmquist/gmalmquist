### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gwen, I use [she/her pronouns](https://pronoun.is/she/her).

I'm a senior software engineer emeritus, and have been coding for way too long. Most of my professional experience is in java, with python taking second place. Rust is my favorite language. I also really <3 TypeScript.

Most of the stuff on here is silly stuff I do for fun, though I was once an active committer for the [pants build system](https://pantsbuild.org).

[Salad Theory](https://salad-theory.com) is my fault.
